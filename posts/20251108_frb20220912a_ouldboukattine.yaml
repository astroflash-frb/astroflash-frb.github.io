body: "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sufficiently energetic to be detectable from luminosity distances up to at least seven billion parsecs (redshift z>1). Probing the maximum energies and luminosities of FRBs constrains their emission mechanism and cosmological population. Here we investigate the maximum energetics of a highly active repeater, FRB 20220912A, using 1,500h of observations. We detect 130 high-energy bursts and find a break in the burst energy distribution, with a flattening of the power-law slope at higher energy. This is consistent with the behaviour of another highly active repeater, FRB 20201124A. Furthermore, we model the rate of the highest-energy bursts and find a turnover at a characteristic spectral energy density of E<sup>char</sup><sub>&nu;</sub> = 2.09<sup>+3.78</sup><sub>-1.04</sub>&times;10<sup>32</sup> erg Hz<sup>-1</sup>. This characteristic maximum energy agrees well with observations of apparently one-off FRBs, suggesting a common physical mechanism for their emission. The extreme burst energies push radiation and source models to their limit."
